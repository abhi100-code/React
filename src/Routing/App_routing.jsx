What is React Router?
React Router is a library that provides routing capabilities for React applications.

Routing means handling navigation between different views.

React Router is the standard routing library for React applications. It enables you to:

Create multiple pages in your single-page application
Handle URL parameters and query strings
Manage browser history and navigation
Create nested routes and layouts
Implement protected routes for authentication
Without a router, your React application would be limited to a single page with no way to navigate between different views.

Install React Router : npm install react-router-dom

BrowserRouter : Your application must be wrapped with the BrowserRouter component to enable routing:

Basic Routing
React Router uses three main components for basic routing:

NavLink: Creates navigation links that update the URL/ FOR NAVBAR
Link: Creates navigation links that update the URL
Routes: A container for all your route definitions
Route: Defines a mapping between a URL path and a component
Let's add navigation links and routes for each link:

Redirect:

const redirect=useNavigate();
redirect('/about');
